    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>We want to bring people together by helping them discover new rafting
      spots in Idaho. We want to build a community where people can share
      their experiences and advice for whitewater rafting. Our hope is that
      our platform can bring people together to have fun and relax. We provide
      valuable information about different whitewater rafting locations,
      weather, level of difficulty and information for renting kayaks and
      rafts. There is plenty of information online, but we feel that there
      needs to be a way to share and read their own adventures. We are set
      aside from other companies because we are built by the community for the
      community.
    </p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>My target audience is people from 20-40 years old who are enthusiastic
      about whitewater rafting. These people are millennials and Gen Z looking
      to get out of their comfort zone to embark on new adventures. They need
      to escape stress from their day-to-day life, so we offer them a platform
      with information on how to do that. People from college students to managers 
      or anyone who would like to experience both calm waters as well as the
      rapids. They want to have an immemorable experience that makes them want
      to come back each year and bring new friends. Our platform allows them a
      place to share their experiences.
