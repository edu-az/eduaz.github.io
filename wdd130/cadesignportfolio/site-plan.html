      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I am a Computer Information Technology student at BYU-I. I love technology and I 
          am passionate about helping people grow their personal brand or business. I build
          easy-to-use websites tailored to their needs, thinking about the user and target
          audience at the same time.  I believe in the power of collaboration and brainstorming
          to get a good picture of the desired product. Because I value communication, I am
          open to input and feedback on my work. I want to meet the expectations of my clients 
          to make them happy.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The target audience is interior design professional companies that focus on both 
        commercial and residential design. These companies have interior design professionals
        looking to recruit interns as well as find new employees to join their team. They 
        will be able to get to know the individual as well as their work and experience in 
        interior design. The website portfolio also allows them to directly contact the 
        individual through social media as well as their personal email.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

        Hello everyone! My name is Camila and I’m an Interior Design student at Ensign College.
        I’m from Peru, but I’m currently living in Utah. I love learning about the different
        styles and eras of art, design, and architecture; and challenging myself for working 
        on new goals and gaining experience.
        Thank you for joining me on this journey!

      <h4>1950s Bungalow</h4>
      <p>
        The 1950s bungalow is a two story home located in Bountiful, UT. The intent of this
        design is to conserve its inviting and cozy feel while creating a modern and functional
        environment by bringing a complete furniture refresh. With the implementation of more
        light and storage Mr. Miller will be able to sell the house faster to an ideal family.
